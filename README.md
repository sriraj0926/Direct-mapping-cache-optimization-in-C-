Cache Simulator
This repository contains a simple cache simulator implemented in C. The simulator consists of a memory subsystem with cache and memory modules. The cache is designed as a direct-mapped cache with a write-allocate policy.

Features
Cache Simulation: Simulates a direct-mapped cache with read and write operations.
Memory Module: Emulates a memory subsystem with random data generation.
Cache Miss and Hit Handling: Demonstrates cache hit and miss scenarios and performs appropriate actions.
Implementation Details
The cache is implemented with a fixed size and block size defined by constants.
Memory is represented as a 2D array.
Cache lines are implemented as structs containing validity, tag, and data fields.
Cache is initialized and managed in memory-efficient ways.
Usage
To run the cache simulator:

Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cachesimulator.git
Navigate to the cloned directory:

bash
Copy code
cd cachesimulator
Compile the source code:

bash
